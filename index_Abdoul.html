    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p class="about">
        Briant's burgers is a family-owned business that has been proudly serving the community since 1985. We are dedicated to providing our customers with delicious, high-quality burgers and fries made fresh to order.
        
        Our signature menu items include our classic cheeseburger and french fries, both of which are made using only the finest, locally-sourced  ingredients. The secret to our success, however, is our homemade sauce - a closely guarded family recipe that has been perfected over generations. One taste, and we're confident you'll be hooked.

Additionally, we regularly participate in local events and initiatives, demonstrating  our dedication to making a positive impact on the neighborhoods we serve.
